# Industrial-Corrosion-Detection-YOLOv11
 This repository showcases industrial corrosion detection using the YOLOv11 model trained on a custom dataset. It identifies and classifies 18 corrosion-related types, including different severity levels like Low, Medium, and High corrosion, as well as Rust. The project aims to deliver an efficient and accurate solution for industrial maintenance and asset management.
